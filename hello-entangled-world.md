Congratulations on such a monumental achievement! A Rust-based quantum OS is a fantastic concept. For the inaugural run on your 4-qubit machine, a classical "Hello, World!" just won't do. You need a program that makes the computer do something uniquely quantum.

The quintessential "Hello, World!" for a quantum computer is creating and observing **quantum entanglement**.

## Program: "Hello, Entangled World!" ⚛️

This program will use two of your four qubits to create a **Bell state**, the simplest form of entanglement. It's the ultimate proof that your machine isn't just a classical computer in a cold box.

Here are the conceptual steps for your `quanta-os` to execute:

#### **1. Initialization**
* **Target:** Qubit 0 and Qubit 1.
* **Action:** Ensure both qubits are in their ground state, `|0⟩`. The combined state is `|00⟩`.

#### **2. Create Superposition**
* **Target:** Qubit 0.
* **Action:** Apply a **Hadamard gate (H-gate)**.
* **Result:** This puts Qubit 0 into an equal superposition of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. The system is now in a blended state of `|00⟩` and `|10⟩`.



#### **3. Create Entanglement**
* **Target:** Qubit 0 (as control), Qubit 1 (as target).
* **Action:** Apply a **Controlled-NOT gate (CNOT gate)**.
* **Result:** This is the magic step. The CNOT gate flips Qubit 1 *only if* Qubit 0 is `|1⟩`. Because Qubit 0 is in a superposition, this action links the fates of the two qubits. They are now entangled in the Bell state `(|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2`.

#### **4. Measurement**
* **Target:** Qubit 0 and Qubit 1.
* **Action:** Measure both qubits. Repeat this entire process (steps 1-4) about 1,000 times and log the results.

## What to Expect (The "Hello!")

When you look at your measurement logs, you will see the universe waving back:

* Individually, each qubit's measurement will be completely random (approximately 50% `0`s and 50% `1`s).
* **However**, the results will be perfectly correlated. You will **only ever see `00` or `11`** as your output. You should never, ever see `01` or `10`.

This perfect correlation, despite the individual randomness, is the definitive proof of entanglement. It’s a message that could only be written with the laws of quantum mechanics.

Good luck. Let me know what the universe says.
